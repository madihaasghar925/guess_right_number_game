Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple Python console-based game where the computer generates a random number and the player tries to guess it.

📌 How the Game Works

The program randomly selects a number within a given range.

The user inputs guesses from the keyboard.

After each guess:

If the guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays:
“Lower number please”

If the guess is lower, the program displays:
“Higher number please”

When the user guesses the correct number, the game:

Congratulates the player

Displays the total number of guesses taken to reach the correct number
